## ENIGMA-PD Visual Quality Control Instructions

Welcome to the **ENIGMA-PD FreeSurfer Visual Quality Control Manual**  
*Last updated: July 2025*

This guide outlines the recommended approach to visually inspect and rate FreeSurfer segmentations as part of the ENIGMA-PD project.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. **Familiarize yourself with ENIGMA quality control standards**  
   Before starting, review the ENIGMA quality control instructions below, including common segmentation errors and regions that are more prone to segmentation failure.

2. **Warm-up: dynamically check a few subjects across all regions**  
   Start by quickly scrolling through around 5–10 subjects to get a sense of the typical variability in segmentations. This dynamic review helps you become familiar with how correctly segmented regions usually appear and what kinds of errors to expect.

3. **For the full dataset, go per region**  
   Most raters prefer evaluating one region at a time across all subjects. This helps with consistency and speeds up spotting systematic issues. As you go, **flag any doubtful cases**, either to revisit later or to share with the ENIGMA core team for second opinion.

### Things to Keep in Mind

- **Be lenient**: Only exclude segmentations with **clear, severe errors** that would lead to **invalid regional estimates**.  
- As you review more subjects, it becomes easier to recognize these major failures quickly.  
- **When in doubt, keep the data**, borderline cases are usually acceptable for analysis.
